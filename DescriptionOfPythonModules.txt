1.  blob.py
-Stores centroid and id information for pixels in segmented images
2.  cameraHandling.py
-Controls the camera. Sends the commands to take and store pictures. 
3.  correlate.py
-Takes 2 arrays of blobs and matches them pairwise according to closest neighbor. Finds deviation numbers for each pair and writes to text file.
4.  cropper.py
-Crops images down to the region outlined by the circular mask placed in front of the lens. 
5.  fullAnalysis.py
-Calls other modules in sequence to create data results from the images produced by the testing device.
6.  generatorCenteredFeatures.py
-Creates the image used for reference in global power corrections.
7.  generatorRefImage.py
-Creates the image used for reference in deviation extraction
8.  globalPower.py
-Determines the global power of the lens from two reference images.
9.  linearActuator.py
-Tracks the position of the lens holder, interfaces with the stepper motor.
10. MoreSettingOptions.py
-Tracks settings for the user interface, controlling button labels, scrolling options etc.
11. segmenter.py
-Extracts arrays of blob objects from pictures of reference image.
12. settingsWidget.py
-Modifies settings for user interface.
13. shapeFinder.py
-Finds the position and size of the circular mask, for cropping purposes.
14. stepperMotor.py
-Interfaces with the GPIO pins of the RPi. Reads from the limit switches and writes to the stepper motor. 
15. touchscreenUI.py
-Runs the user interface for the testing device. The primary script to launch in order to collect data.
16. visualize.py
-Creates visualizations of the deviation data. Writes a histogram and heatmap to file.
