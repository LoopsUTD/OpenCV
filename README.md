# Installation

Using this software requires Python 3.6, A raspberry Pi with accessible GPIO headers, and a camera that is supported by our image capturing library, libgphoto2.

## Installation Notes:

Other Dependencies:
	- python pip pillow: requires the apt-get install of:
		- libjpeg-dev, zlib1g-dev, and libpng-devd
	- libgphoto2 needs to be installed using linuxbrew.
		- look up installation at (linuxbrew.sh)[https://linuxbrew.sh] to see what this looks like
	- after you brew install and make, you will be able to access gphoto2. TODO: update this with the link used to appropriately add gphoto2 to $PATH
